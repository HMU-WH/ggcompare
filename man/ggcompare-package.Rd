\title{ggcompare: Mean Comparison in 'ggplot2'}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

Add mean comparison annotations to a 'ggplot'. This package provides an easy way to indicate if two or more groups are significantly different in a 'ggplot'. Usually you do not need to specify the test method, you only need to tell `stat_compare` whether you want to perform a parametric test or a nonparametric test, and `stat_compare` will automatically choose the appropriate test method based on your data. For comparisons between two groups, the p-value is calculated by t-test (parametric) or Wilcoxon rank sum test (nonparametric). For comparisons among more than two groups, the p-value is calculated by One-way ANOVA (parametric) or Kruskal-Wallis test (nonparametric).

Description: Add mean comparison annotations to a 'ggplot'. 
             This package provides an easy way to indicate if two or more groups are significantly different in a 'ggplot'. 
             Usually you do not need to specify the test method, you only need to tell stat_compare() whether you want to perform a parametric test or a nonparametric test, and stat_compare() will automatically choose the appropriate test method based on your data. 
             For comparisons between two groups, the p-value is calculated by t-test (parametric) or Wilcoxon rank sum test (nonparametric). For comparisons among more than two groups, the p-value is calculated by One-way ANOVA (parametric) or Kruskal-Wallis test (nonparametric).
